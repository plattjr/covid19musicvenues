# Music Venue Closures Due to Covid-19 Pandemic

*A mock freelance job*

I was approached by [Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9451748/venues-closing-coronavirus-america-list/) Online Magazine to create a map highlighting the opening and closing of states in regards to social gatherings while documenting the permanent closures of independent music venues across the United States.  This would be used by the [National Independent Venues Association's](https://www.nivassoc.org/) as supplemental visual aid for the [Save Our Stage Act](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e91157c96fe495a4baf48f2/t/5f247dd0f1862620332f0ae5/1596227025091/For+Introduction_Save+Our+Stages+Act.pdf), which is awaiting Congressional approval and hopefully a part of a future stimulus package.
