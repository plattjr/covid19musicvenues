# Music Venue Closures Due to Covid-19 Pandemic

*A mock freelance job*

I was approached by [Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9451748/venues-closing-coronavirus-america-list/) Online Magazine to create a map highlighting the opening and closing of states in regards to social gatherings while documenting the permanent closures of independent music venues across the United States.  This would be used by the [National Independent Venues Association's](https://www.nivassoc.org/) as supplemental visual aid for the [Save Our Stage Act](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e91157c96fe495a4baf48f2/t/5f247dd0f1862620332f0ae5/1596227025091/For+Introduction_Save+Our+Stages+Act.pdf), which is awaiting Congressional approval and hopefully a part of a future stimulus package.

The individual states are divided into open, closed, and open with restriction categories.  Future plans is to update every state as they reopen or close and add interaction which would further break down each state's guidelines regarding social gathering limits.  The venue closure symbology is a simple point layer with added transparency so you can see some hotspots of closures.  You can click on each point to see venue name and location.  Currently there are less than 100 reported closures but many venues have said they would shut down by the end of the year if no further financial aid is headed their way.  So, for future plans on the web application I plan to add every venue that is a part of NIVA (awaiting their database) and breakdown the data into open, closed, adapted to new business model, and at risk of closing.  Then also include attributes like venue capacity, average number of events per year, etc.  It would also be possible to calculate the economic impact the closures are having on a geographic area.
